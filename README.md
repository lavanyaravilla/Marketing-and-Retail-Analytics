# Problem Statement - I 
  In the recent past, e-commerce companies have emerged and flourished in the industry. They offer the convenience to order from a wide   variety of options from the comfort of one’s home. But how do they offer these “wide variety of options or products”?
  To be able to meet the demands of the customers, any e-commerce company would obviously need to store tons and tons of products in warehouses. Now, some of these warehoused products might be fast-moving products which sell very quickly and some others might be slow-moving.
  Each of the products being stored incurs a cost to the company in terms of space and maintenance. Since storing these products obviously add to the costs that the company incurs, it is absolutely necessary for the organisations to plan their inventory well.
  Now, OList is one such e-commerce company that has faced some losses recently and they want to manage their inventory very well so as to reduce any unnecessary costs that they might be bearing.
  In this assignment, you have to manage the inventory cost of this e-commerce company OList. You need to identify top products that contribute to the revenue and also use market basket analysis to analyse the purchase behaviour of individual customers to estimate with relative certainty, what items are more likely to be purchased individually or in combination with some other products.
# Problem Statement - II 
  After developing an understanding of the problem statement and the dataset, it is important to think about your approach to solve the problem. It is always advisable to break down a complex problem into smaller, simpler ones. This is called structured problem solving.
  The structured problem approach that you will be using here is the 80-20 rule of the Pareto analysis. In general, this 80-20 rule asserts that 80% of outcomes (or outputs) result from 20% of all causes (or inputs) for any given event. Again, the 80-20 number is not iron-clad and can be tweaked a little on a case by case basis. After using Pareto for your analysis let us see what all other important aspects are there that you need to consider to solve the problem.
